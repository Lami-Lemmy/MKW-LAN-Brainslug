## Build Instructions
Check https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek for build instructions \
The files from PowerPC_EABI_Tools/Command_Line_Tool need to be placed in a folder called 'cw' \

These files are used to build the required E/J/K/P.bin. These binaries load the LE-CODE binary (lecode-XXX.bin) that is required in many Custom Track Distributions. (see main README)
These files have been modified from the original variety pack as to NOT ad aditional mods to mario kart.
Therefore, the only thing the binaries do in this case is load lecode-XXX.bin.
To build the required P.bin (or the other regions for that matter) run build-modified.bat inside projects/vp
