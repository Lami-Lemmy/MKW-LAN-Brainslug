Check https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek for build instructions
The files from PowerPC_EABI_Tools/Command_Line_Tool need to be placed in a folder called 'cw'

These files have been modified from the original variety pack as to NOT ad aditional mods to mario kart.
The only thing E.bin does in this case is load le-code.bin
To build the required E.bin (or the other regions for that matter) run build.bat inside projects/vp
